# Quick start for application developers
Start with one of our [samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/AMBROSIA/tree/master/Samples) to get a service up and running on AMBROSIA. 

# Quick start for AMBROSIA contributors

## Build from source
Build the Ambrosia Immortal coordinator and C# client code generator
with this Bash script:

    ./build_dotnetcore_bindist.sh

Given a .NET Core SDK, this will work on Windows, Mac OS, or Linux.
After that, you have an AMBROSIA binary distribution built inside the
`./bin` directory within your working copy.
