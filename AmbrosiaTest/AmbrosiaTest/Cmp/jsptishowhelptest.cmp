  PTI Parameters:
  ===============
  -h|--help                    : [Common] Displays this help message
  -ir|--instanceRole=          : [Common] The role of this instance in the test ('Server', 'Client', or 'Combined'); defaults to 'Combined'
  -m|--memoryUsed=             : [Common] Optional "padding" (in bytes) used to simulate large checkpoints by being included in app state; defaults to 0
  -c|--autoContinue=           : [Common] Whether to continue automatically at startup (if true), or wait for the 'Enter' key (if false); defaults to true
  -sin|--serverInstanceName=   : [Client] The name of the instance that's acting in the 'Server' role for the test; only required when --role is 'Client'
  -bpr|--bytesPerRound=        : [Client] The total number of message payload bytes that will be sent in a single round; defaults to 1 GB
  -bsc|--batchSizeCutoff=      : [Client] Once the total number of message payload bytes queued reaches (or exceeds) this limit, then the batch will be sent; defaults to 10 MB
  -mms|--maxMessageSize=       : [Client] The maximum size (in bytes) of the message payload; must be a power of 2 (eg. 65536), and be at least 64; defaults to 64KB
  -n|--numOfRounds=            : [Client] The number of rounds (of size bytesPerRound) to work through; each round will use a [potentially] different message size; defaults to 1
  -nds|--noDescendingSize      : [Client] Disables descending (halving) the message size after each round; instead, a random size [power of 2] between 64 and --maxMessageSize will be used
  -fms|--fixedMessageSize      : [Client] All messages (in all rounds) will be of size --maxMessageSize; --noDescendingSize (if also supplied) will be ignored
  -eeb|--expectedEchoedBytes=  : [Client] The total number of "echoed" bytes expected to be received from the server when --bidirectional is specified; the client will report a "success" message when this number of bytes have been received
  -nhc|--noHealthCheck         : [Server] Disables the periodic server health check (requested via an Impulse message)
  -bd|--bidirectional          : [Server] Enables echoing the 'doWork' method call back to the client(s)
  -efb|--expectedFinalBytes=   : [Server] The total number of bytes expected to be received from all clients; the server will report a "success" message when this number of bytes have been received
